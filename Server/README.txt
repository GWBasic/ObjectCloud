Note:

There are two solution files:
   ObjectCloud2008.sln
      - and -
   ObjectCloud2005.sln

ObjectCloud2008.sln is for Visual Studio 2008, and ObjectCloud2005.sln is
for Visual Studio 2005.  Only the 2008 version is actively maintained.  The
2005 version is kept because the professional versions of Visual Studio
tend to be very expensive, yet have highly valuable debugging features for
multithreaded applications.
