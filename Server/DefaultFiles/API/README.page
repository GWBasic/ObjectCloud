<div>ObjectCloud API README</div><p>The /API folder contains a hodgepodge of popular open-source Javascript libraries and ObjectCloud-specific Javascript libraries.</p><p>Be careful when using jQuery.&nbsp; ObjectCloud's APIs use Prototype for AJAX.&nbsp; Both Prototype and jQuery define a $("...") function.<br></p><p>Please feel free to submit any open-source Javascript library into the /API folder.&nbsp; For more complicated libraries that use multiple files, please put the library in its own folder.&nbsp; You an even submit competing libraries!&nbsp; Often, competing libraries have differences that make them appealing in different contexts.&nbsp; For example, both Prototype and jQuery are included; and Prototype and json2 are included.<br></p><p>Forking and/or altering 3rd-party open-source libraries is discouraged unless a bug in the library makes them inoperable with ObjectCloud.&nbsp; If you alter a 3rd-party library, please clearly indicate the changes.</p><p>When adding a library, remove all versioning from the filename.&nbsp; Only keep versioning in a filename if multiple versions of a library need to be included; such as in scenarios where there are significant differences between APIs, or when a version has a bug.<br></p>
