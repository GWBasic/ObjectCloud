<div>Release Notes</div><h1>January 20, 2010: 1.0, alpha:2-0 Camber in the cucumber</h1><p>Enhanced server-side Javascript to allow for some server-side rendering of HTML, and scripting.</p><p>Re-worked the Javascript APIs for both server-side and browser-side Javascript to pass all arguments in a single Javascript object. &nbsp;This allows the AJAX API to evolve without breaking old code.</p><p>Removed the Prototype&nbsp;dependency&nbsp;from the browser-side Javascript API. &nbsp;This allows ObjectCloud to work with frameworks that would conflict or replace Prototype.</p><p>Implemented pages for groups.</p><p>Implemented the ability to specify that a group is personal, private, or public. &nbsp;A personal group is for one's own personal use and isn't meant to be publicly visible. &nbsp;(IE, the members don't know that they're part of a group.) &nbsp;A private group is visible to all members, but only the owner can control membership. &nbsp;A public group is visible to everyone and everyone can join.</p><p>Implemented some caching of query results for certain queries that are run numerous times when hosting a static file that uses a lot of web components. &nbsp;This dramatically makes ObjectCloud faster. &nbsp;Specifically, the queries that determine what groups a user is in, and what permission a user has to a file, are now cached in RAM.</p><h1>December 8, 2009: 1.0, alpha:1-2 The glory is all gummy</h1><p>Disabled the social bar on all known mobile platforms<br></p><p>Re-wrote the cache to be less susceptible to deadlocking, and to require less worker threads to keep the caches clean.</p><p>Implemented an algorithm to keep cached objects in memory longer, and only to release unused objects as memory use increases.</p><p>Fixed indexing issues in the session manager that caused it to run slowly.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">(Note:&nbsp; The upgrade process will end all existing sessions!)</span><br></p><p>Replaced usage of the C# lock keyword with a timed lock that defaults to 10 seconds.&nbsp; This is useful in tracking down deadlocks.&nbsp; Also added a timeout for long-running database operations.<br></p><p>Added the blogum system to have a better blog / forum.</p><p>Added ability to reply to any .page file.</p><p>Updated the API to support named permissions on functions.<br></p><p>Updated the API to allow named relationships among files in a directory.<br></p><p>Added ability to expose underlying web-accessible methods when an object is wrapped with JavaScript.&nbsp; This is disabled by default for security reasons.</p><h2>Known issues</h2>
<p>Deleting files that have a SQLite database aren't being cleaned up
correctly, nor are they closing their open connections to the database.</p><h1>November 25, 2009:&nbsp;1.0, alpha:1-2 Jint' Ses Ion's in Dex with the Rhino</h1><p>Fixed some minor issues with the Social Bar that were preventing it from showing up unless someone was already present.</p><p>Fixed an issue where the database connection was closed while a long-running query ran.</p><p>Added indexes to many different object times.&nbsp; This significantly improves the logger's performance.&nbsp; This should mitigate an issue where ObjectCloud would become unresponsive while cleaning its logs.</p><p>Fixed potential null reference exception when re-using a socket in HTTP streaming mode.</p><h1>November 17, 2009: 1.0 alpha:1-1 Peas and Ketchup</h1><p>Introduced Comet features, including automatic refresh of a view of a directory if it's modified in another window, automatic refresh of a page if it's modified in another window, and the Social Bar.</p><h1>October 30, 2009:&nbsp; 1.0, alpha:1-0 Can I have a cookie from the HttpListener?</h1><p>Initial release<br></p>
