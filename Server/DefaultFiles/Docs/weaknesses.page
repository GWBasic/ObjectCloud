{"Title":"When not to use ObjectCloud","Contents":"\n<p><a href=\"about.page\">About ObjectCloud</a></p><p>Let's face it. &#160;Nothing's perfect. &#160;ObjectCloud is very alpha. &#160;While it's a wonderful piece of software that saves harmless kittens and makes julian fries; there are some use cases that it's just not designed to handle. &#160;This document describes situations where you might be better off with other web development systems.</p><h1>Maturity</h1><p>ObjectCloud is very alpha, therefore, if you're looking for a web development platform that's mature, stable, and bug-free, ObjectCloud probably isn't the best to use.</p><h1>Scalability</h1><p>The trendy thing to do today is to have a single web application hosted in a single place and scale to millions of users.&#160; An example is <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://code.google.com/appengine/\">Google App Engine</a>.&#160; The intention with ObjectCloud is to, for the immediate future, target smaller-scale applications that might only have 100-200 users.&#160; ObjectCloud scales through decentralization; although future versions of ObjectCloud might be able to handle larger loads.<br/></p><h1>Performance</h1><p>No performance testing is performed.&#160; Performance improvements are expected in future releases.</p><h1>Stability</h1><p>As ObjectCloud is very alpha, stability is a concern.&#160; A primary cause of instability on Windows comes from server-side Javascript.&#160; Specifically, ObjectCloud's Javascript environment uses <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/\">Rhino</a> running under <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://www.ikvm.net/\">IKVM</a>.&#160; This particular combination tends to cause lots of ugly crashes when hosted on Windows.</p><h1>Server-Side Programming</h1><p>ObjectCloud is designed to minimize server-side programming.&#160; One consequence is that ObjectCloud relies more on browser Javascript to render HTML instead of server-side scripting.&#160; Web applications that would require a heavy amount of server-side programming are not a good choice for ObjectCloud; unless the server-side programming is intended to extend the object paradigm by adding more core data types.</p><p>At this point, only server-side Javascript is documented.&#160; There are ways to add more core data types, proxies, and other complicated .Net code.&#160; These are undocumented for now.</p><p><a href=\"about.page\">About ObjectCloud</a></p>"}
