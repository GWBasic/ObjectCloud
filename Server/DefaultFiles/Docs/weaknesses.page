{"Title":"Weaknesses","Contents":"\n<p>ObjectCloud is alpha software and has some weaknesses. This page describes issues and tradeoffs when using ObjectCloud.</p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><h1>Stability</h1><p>ObjectCloud is primarily tested with light load. Although the alpha server crashes much less often then when we first ran it, it hasn't been subject to high load and may not be stable under such scenarios.</p><h1>Scalability</h1><p>ObjectCloud scales through decentralization, although each instance can only handle a small group of users.</p><p>For more scalable deployments, please contact <a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"http://appfeeds.com\">AppFeeds</a>.</p><h1>Performance</h1><p>ObjectCloud performs well for single users. No&#160;performance testing is performed for multiple users.</p><h1>Server-Side Programming</h1><p>ObjectCloud is designed to minimize server-side programming. Its server-side Javascript system is still experimental. The best applications to develop on ObjectCloud are those that don't require a lot of server-side programming.</p>"}
