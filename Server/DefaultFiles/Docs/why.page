{"Title":"Why ObjectCloud?","Contents":"<p><a href=\"/Docs/about.page\">About ObjectCloud</a></p><h1>A Very Simple Explanation<br/>\n</h1>\n<p>ObjectCloud's goal is to put you, the user, in control of your stuff\nwhen it's on the web or in the cloud. &#160;You know, baby photos, TODO lists, files, ect.\n&#160;It lets you share photos, documents, ect with anyone on the internet,\neven if they don't have an account with ObjectCloud. &#160;To do this,\nObjectCloud supports OpenId.</p>\n<p>An eventual goal is to let you move or copy your files to another\nObjectCloud instance on the internet.&#160; By keeping your stuff in\nObjectCloud, it is always available whenever there is an internet\nconnection.&#160; You can access it from any computer, phone, or television\nwith a web browser.&#160; If your computer breaks down, or you loose your\nlaptop, your stuff is still safe in ObjectCloud.&#160; This is because ObjectCloud takes advantage of cloud-style backup systems.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>ObjectCloud does all this by integrating Operating-System style\nfeatures into the web server.&#160; This means that you don't have to\nre-learn how to share or upload a file when you use different\nprograms.&#160; It also helps programmers build better web applications by\nproviding them with a vast set of pre-written functionality to build on\ntop of.</p>\n<p>To start using ObjectCloud, take a look at the <a target=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"walkthrough.page\">walkthrough</a>.<br/>\n</p>\n<h1>A More Technical Explanation</h1>\n<p>ObjectCloud is a Web Server designed like an operating system.&#160; It is intended to be hosted in a \"cloud-style\" VM and  a building block for \"Platform as a Service.\"&#160; As each\nObjectCloud instance is its own web server; ObjectCloud is completely\nde-centralized.&#160; This means that an ObjectCloud developer isn't\ndependent on a single company or consortium; and the end user can rely\non open competition among service providers.&#160; A goal of ObjectCloud is to handle about 80% of server-side programming for simple web applications.<br/></p><p>There are tangible advantages for both the end user and software developer:<br/></p><ul><li>End-user:</li><ul><li>A common look and feel among all applications</li><li>No need to re-learn simple tasks like sharing an item with a friend, or uploading</li><li>A unified place to keep all web data</li><li>Choice in which programs are used to view and manipulate files<br/></li></ul><li>Software Developer:</li><ul><li>Ability to use or bypass the common look and feel.<br/></li><li>A \"pre-baked\" Javascript API for manipulating data on the server</li><li>Components for managing and sharing files</li><li>Built-in user management integrated with OpenID</li><li>Popular Javascript libraries are included and <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"/API\">placed into a common location</a></li></ul><ul><li>Access to core persistent data structures without the need to re-write simple data access routines:</li><ul><li>Text files</li><li>Name-value pairs</li><li>Embedded database</li></ul><li>Simplified techniques for server-side data validation<br/></li></ul></ul><p>ObjectCloud's target use case is for web applications that have simple data storage needs, such as web-based document, presentation, and image editors.&#160; The primary goal is to enable simple web-based collaboration without relying on a 3rd party to host the data.&#160; ObjectCloud provides a wealth of pre-written server-side APIs.</p><p>The common look and feel on an ObjectCloud server can be changed by a system administrator or application integrator.&#160; This allows hosting services and bundled applications to brand themselves and have a unique look and feel that is different from other ObjectCloud servers and bundles.<br/></p><h1>Dollars and Cents</h1><p>The true value of ObjectCloud comes from the applications written on top of it.&#160; As a result; ObjectCloud's current focus is to be the best development platform for future web applications.</p><p><a href=\"about.page\">About ObjectCloud</a></p>\n\n"}
