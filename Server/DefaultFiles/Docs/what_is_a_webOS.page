{"Title":"What is a WebOS?","Contents":"\n\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"about.page\">About ObjectCloud\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\n   The word \"WebOS\" is a rather ambiguous term where the implied meaning translates to different emotions based on one's\n   background with software technology. Some people envision a desktop within a web browser; some people see the entire web as an operating system; and other people encounter cognitive dissonance.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>ObjectCloud's definition of a WebOS is:\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\u003Cem>A WebOS is a program, software suite, or\necosystem of software that provides:\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\u003Cul>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Cem>A standard web-based API for file manipulation, user management, and security;\u003C/em>\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cem>A standard set\nof utilities or programs for file, permissions, and user management; and\u003C/em>\u003C/li>\u003Cli style=\"font-style: italic;\">A set of components and libraries for a standard look and feel among decoupled web applications.\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003C/ul>\u003Cp>A webOS isn't a classical operating system; yet the term \"OS\" is built upon because a webOS provides many features that one expects from today's modern operating systems like Linux and MacOS.&nbsp; These include, but are not limited to, and API, utilities, security, and a common look and feel.\u003Cbr>\u003C/p>\u003Ch2>Philosophy\u003C/h2>\n\n\u003Cp>\n   ObjectCloud emulates an operating system from the viewpoint of the programmer or software developer.  To\n   the software developer, the Operating System is:\n\n   \u003C/p>\u003Cul>\n       \u003Cli>The API that he or she programs with\u003C/li>\n       \u003Cli>The common GUI components that are exposed to end users for actions that are common to all programs, such as for\n       opening and saving files\u003C/li>\n       \u003Cli>A set of common utility programs available to all end users\u003C/li>\n       \u003Cli>A way to navigate to one's programs and data\u003C/li>\n   \u003C/ul>\n\n\n\u003Cp>\n   ObjectCloud is designed to fit into this viewpoint.  It provides an API for creating web applications and a foundation\n   for a common set of GUI components.  ObjectCloud contains common rudimentary utilities; and provides a way to navigate,\n   access, and control one's data.  Thus, assuming that a WebOS doesn't need to concern itself with things like paging,\n   memory management, interrups, ect; ObjectCloud is a \"WebOS.\"\n\u003C/p>\n\n\u003Ch2>Refining the Definition\u003C/h2>\n   \n\n\n\u003Cp>\nTo further refine the definition of WebOS, one must be open to to the idea that a WebOS borrows from the definition of\n\"Operating System,\" but is not an \"Operating System\" by definition.&nbsp; Considering\nthat a \"WebOS\" has similar functions to an \"Operating System,\" it is justified to use a similar-sounding word.  One does not\nhave to consider a WebOS to be an \"Operating System,\" but merely to provide \"Operating System\"-like features for web-based\nprograms.&nbsp; \u003Cem>\u003C/em>Subjects such as interrups, paging, memory\nmanagement, and processes are outside of the scope of WebOSes.\n\u003C/p>\n\n\u003Ch2>Some Founding Principles\u003C/h2>\n\n\u003Cp>\n   Andrew Rondeau, ObjectCloud's inventor and lead developer, is of the opinion that web-based applications will eventually\n   replace desktop applications.  Andrew does not see the \"desktop in a web browser\" as an effective direction to replacing\n   desktop applications as they don't really improve on existing technology.  There are many thin-client technologies that\n   allow remote access to traditional operating systems like Windows, Mac, and Linux.  VNC even has a client that runs in a\n   web browser.  Therefore, it is difficult to justify an investment into a web-desktop application when remotely accessing\n   a similar application on Windows, Mac, or Linux has significantly less development risk.\n\u003C/p>\n\n\u003Cp>\n   Andrew envisioned ObjectCloud as a means to provide operating system functionality to web applications without\n   needing to re-invent the desktop.  It lets a web developer create an application with minimal server-side programming,\n   just as today's software developer doesn't need to worry about hardware issues when programming with a modern operating\n   system.  User management based on OpenID is built into ObjectCloud, just like Windows, Mac, and Linux have built-in\n   user management utilities and APIs.\n\u003C/p>\n\n\u003Cp>\n   ObjectCloud provides the above operating system functionality without requiring a web application to conform to the\n   confines of a web desktop.  It is flexible enough to adapt to future web-based UI systems.  Furthermore, one could\n   potentially develop a web desktop on top of ObjectCloud, if desired. \u003Cbr>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"about.page\">About ObjectCloud\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n"}
