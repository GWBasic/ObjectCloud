{"Title":"Simple Social Computing Protocol: Friending","Contents":"\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/></p><p>SSCP&#160;recommends&#160;that servers support some form of friending and/or following. It&#160;recommends, but does not require, that messages from someone that isn't a friend, or isn't being followed, are either discarded or hidden.</p><p>Friending is supported in two steps. When displaying an \"Add user as a friend\" on a user's profile, the server handles the button by looking up the currently-logged-in user's XRD document and finding the \"sscp.friend\" endpoint. The currently-logged-in user's browser is then directed to POST to the specified endpoint. Friendship requests are then sent as a well-known type of message.</p>"}
