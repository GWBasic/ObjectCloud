{"Title":"ObjectCloud: About","Contents":"<p>ObjectCloud is an open-source web server designed like an operating system. It has some simple distributed social networking features. ObjectCloud's goal is to give an organization a central place for web-accesible applications and data; unlike today where data and applications are spread among many different web sites.</p><p>The advantage of using web applications built on top of ObjectCloud is that data from one application can be re-used in another application, similar to how an MP3 file can be reused in WinAmp, Windows Media Player, iTunes, and VLC. Likewise, for the security-conscious, ObjectCloud can be hosted anywhere. It can be hosted on a personal cable modem, behind an organization's firewall, or on many of the commodity cloud hosting providers.</p><p>Much like desktop operating systems provide a common look-and-feel among applications, common components like the \"file open\" dialog box, and abstractions like printer drivers; ObjectCloud aims to provide the same basic building blocks for web applications.</p><p>ObjectCloud is open source with a <a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"/Docs/license.oc\">license</a>&#160;that allows proprietary plugins. The project aims&#160;to establish an open and distributed social network that operates like email by providing a reference implementation that anyone can host, and is completely open source.&#160;Its client-server protocol is designed to support mobile applications.</p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><p></p><h1>Social Networking and&#160;Collaboration</h1><p>Popular social networks like Facebook demonstrate a powerful UI paradigm for with many people. ObjectCloud aims to establish a distributed social network centered around&#160;collaboration&#160;with powerful web applications. Furthermore, much like how anyone with an email address can email anyone else, regardless of email software or provider; ObjectCloud aims to adopt and&#160;influence&#160;federated social networking protocols so that its&#160;collaboration&#160;platform can work with technology from other vendors.</p><h2>Philosophy</h2><p>It's important that ObjectCloud is easy to experiment with. ObjectCloud allows complete and open&#160;experimentation in any way by anyone with minimal resources or investment. It is designed for easy test-driving without recompiling, setting up a database, or a complicated installation on Windows, Mac, and Linux.</p><p>ObjectCloud comes with no dependancies on proprietary products or services. &#160;The community is free to create and use such dependancies.</p><h1>Features</h1><h2>Customization</h2><p>ObjectCloud's templating system allows quick creation of a <a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"/Docs/customize.page\">custom-branded site</a>.</p><h2>Flexible Hosting</h2><p>You may host ObjectCloud on&#160;premises, through many of the various cloud providers, or arrange for <a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"http://appfeeds.com\">commercial hosting</a>. See <a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"/Docs/tryit.page\">Try it Out</a>&#160;for information on setting up an ObjectCloud server.</p><h2>Security</h2><p>ObjectCloud is designed with a powerful security layer, built-in permission model, and a secured social networking protocol.</p><h2>Application Platform</h2><p>ObjectCloud has a flexible and powerful in-browser Javascript or RESTful API for data access <u>without</u> server-side scripting, database schema manipulation, sql, php, python, or ruby. All Javascript / RESTful APIs are present in an experimental server-side Javascript system to address security and performance problems.</p><p>Web Applications created on ObjectCloud naturally fit into the security model and distributed social network.
