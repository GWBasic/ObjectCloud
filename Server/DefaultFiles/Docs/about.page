{"Title":"ObjectCloud: About","Contents":"<p>ObjectCloud is an open-source web server for distributed social networking. It is open source with a <a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"/Docs/license.oc\">license</a>&#160;that allows proprietary plugins.</p><p>We aim to establish an open and distributed social network that operates like email by providing a reference implementation that anyone can host, and is completely open source.</p><p>ObjectCloud provides a web application platform that supports real-time social messaging. Its client-server protocol is designed to support mobile applications.</p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><p></p><h1>Why an Open and Distributed Social Network?</h1><p>Email is the perfect example of why open and distributed social networking is needed. &#160;Anyone with an email address can email anyone else, even when they use different services. This kind of openness is needed with social networking.</p><p>The implication is that anyone can host their own site and interact with anyone from other social networks.</p><h2>Philosophy</h2><p>It's important that ObjectCloud is easy to experiment with. ObjectCloud allows complete and open&#160;experimentation in any way by anyone with minimal resources or investment. It is designed for easy test-driving without recompiling, setting up a database, or a complicated installation on Windows, Mac, and Linux. ObjectCloud provides a ready-to-use reference implementation for Particle, our&#160;distributed social computing protocol.&#160;</p><p>ObjectCloud comes with no dependancies on proprietary products or services. &#160;The community is free to create and use such dependancies.</p><h1>Features</h1><h2>Customization</h2><p>ObjectCloud's templating system allows quick creation of a <a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"/Docs/customize.page\">custom-branded social network</a>.</p><h2>Flexible Hosting</h2><p>You may host ObjectCloud on&#160;premises, through many of the various cloud providers, or arrange for <a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"http://appfeeds.com\">commercial hosting</a>. See <a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"/Docs/tryit.page\">Try it Out</a>&#160;for information on setting up an ObjectCloud server.</p><h2>Security</h2><p>ObjectCloud is designed with a powerful security layer, built-in permission model, and a secured social networking protocol.</p><h2>Application Platform</h2><p>ObjectCloud has a flexible and powerful in-browser Javascript or RESTful API for data access <u>without</u> server-side scripting, database schema manipulation, sql, php, python, or ruby. All Javascript / RESTful APIs are present in an experimental server-side Javascript system to address security and performance problems.</p><p>Web Applications created on ObjectCloud naturally fit into the security model and distributed social network.
