This kind of openness is needed with social networking.</p><p>The implication is that anyone can host their own site and interact with anyone from other social networks.</p><h2>Philosophy</h2><p>ObjectCloud provides a reference implementation of a complete working server for Particle, its distributed social computing protocol. This is to allow complete and open experimentation in any way by anyone with minimal resources or investment. It is designed for easy test-driving without compiling on Windows, Mac, and Linux.</p><p>ObjectCloud comes with no dependancies on proprietary products or services. &#160;The community is free to create and use such dependancies.</p><h1>Features</h1><h2>Customization</h2><p>ObjectCloud's templating system allows quick creation of a <a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"/Docs/customize.page\">custom-branded social network</a>.</p><h2>Flexible Hosting</h2><p>You may host ObjectCloud on&#160;premises, through many of the various cloud providers, or arrange for <a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"http://appfeeds.com\">commercial hosting</a>.
