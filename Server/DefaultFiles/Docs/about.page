{"Title":"ObjectCloud: About","Contents":"<p>ObjectCloud is an open-source web server designed to mix lightweight web applications with open and distributed social networking. At its core, ObjectCloud is like an operating system. &#160;Fundamental to ObjectCloud is security, ease-of-programming, and openness. Users may share data with anyone who has an OpenID.</p><p>ObjectCloud is released under the&#160;<a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"http://opensource.org/licenses/simpl-2.0.html\">SimPL 2.0</a>&#160;license with generous terms for proprietary plugins.

This is to allow complete and open experimentation in any way by anyone with minimal resources or investment. It is designed for easy test-driving without compiling on Windows, Mac, and Linux.</p><p>ObjectCloud comes with no dependancies on proprietary products or services. &#160;The community is free to create and use such dependancies.</p><h1>Features</h1><h2>Custom Branded Social Networking</h2><p>ObjectCloud's templating system allows quick creation of a custom-branded social network.</p><h2>Flexible Hosting</h2><p>You may host ObjectCloud on&#160;premises, through many of the various cloud providers, or arrange for <a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"http://appfeeds.com\">commercial hosting</a>. See <a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"/Docs/tryit.page\">Try it Out</a>&#160;for information on setting up an ObjectCloud server.</p><h2>Security</h2><p>ObjectCloud is designed with a powerful security layer, built-in permission model, and a secured social networking protocol.</p><h2>Simplified Web Programming</h2><p>ObjectCloud has a flexible and powerful in-browser Javascript or RESTful API for data access without server-side scripting, database schema manipulation, sql, php, python, or ruby. All Javascript / RESTful APIs are present in an experimental server-side Javascript system to address security and performance problems.</p><p>Web Applications created on ObjectCloud naturally fit into the security model and distributed social network.
