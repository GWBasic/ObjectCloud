<div>Wanna help?</div><p><a href="about.page">About ObjectCloud</a></p><p>ObjectCloud is currently very alpha, and help is appreciated. &nbsp;Listed below are various tasks that someone could take on:</p><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Forums</span>:&nbsp; I'd like some kind of forum system.&nbsp; For example, I'd like a .forum file to be an embedded database with a 1-topic forum.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Improve the blog</span>:&nbsp; The blog system is quite clunky.&nbsp; Can we make it better?</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">IE Compatibility</span>:&nbsp;
Only minimal testing with IE is performed, and only at version 8.&nbsp; I'd
like to have "good" IE 7 &amp; 8 support, and rudimentary IE 6 support.<br>
</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Canvaspaint</span>:&nbsp; I'd like
Canvaspaint to have more of an ObjectCloud look &amp; feel.&nbsp; (It was a
quick hack-in.)&nbsp; Specifically, I'd like it to look like Weco, Pears,
and nicEdit.&nbsp; This means I'd like the paint area to size itself to the
browser window, and I'd like to hide a lot of the author's comments.&nbsp; Some functionality, like text and polygons, is also missing.<br></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Some kind of componentized drop-down menu system</span>:&nbsp; The drop-down menu system in Canvaspaint looks cool.&nbsp; I'd like that abstracted out a bit so it can be reusable.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Code hosting</span>:&nbsp; Right now I use my personal (free) Perforce instance to host ObjectCloud.&nbsp; I'd like to move it to something like SourceForge.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bug Tracking</span>:&nbsp; It would be cool if we had an ObjectCloud based bug tracker, but a free online bug tracker would be cool</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Eye-candy</span>:&nbsp; Let's make ObjectCloud look as cool as possible</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">"File Open" and "File Save" dialogs</span>:&nbsp;
Windows, Mac, and Linux all have generic File Open and Save dialogs
that are re-used by many applications.&nbsp; I'd like the same, with the
addition of a "File Upload" dialog.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Multiple File Upload</span>:&nbsp;
Update the directory viewer to add another &lt;input&gt; tag for
another file when the first one is specified.&nbsp; This will require
working with me to implement some server-modifications.<br></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">nicEdit improvements</span>:&nbsp; nicEdit.wchtml uses a <a target="_blank" title="" href="http://nicedit.com/">Javascript-based HTML editor called nicEdit</a>.&nbsp; Some cool features that I'd like to integrate are:</li><ul><li>A way to browse the file system when adding a link or image</li><li>A way to directly upload images into the document.</li><li>A table editor would also be cool.</li><li>I'd also like to trap a lot of keystrokes like Apple-S,
Apple-B, Apple-I, and "do" what one would normally expect in a desktop
document editor.</li></ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">"Magic" .page transitions</span>:&nbsp; I'd like the .page viewer to find all links to other .page files.&nbsp; When such a link is clicked, I'd like the next page to be completely loaded through AJAX and the browser's URL refreshed.&nbsp; This would result in a faster load then if the entire .page file was reloaded and re-rendered in the browser.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Javascript without IKVM</span>:&nbsp; Specifically, ObjectCloud's Javascript environment uses <a target="_blank" title="" href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/">Rhino</a> running under <a target="_blank" title="" href="http://www.ikvm.net/">IKVM</a>.&nbsp; This particular combination tends to cause lots of ugly crashes.&nbsp; In order to keep ObjectCloud platform independent; I'd like to stick with Rhino for the time being.&nbsp; An interesting technique that I'd like to explore is to call into Rhino by calling into Java through PInvoke instead of IKVM.&nbsp; Another more challenging technique would be to port <a target="_blank" title="" href="http://code.google.com/p/v8/">V8</a> to <a target="_blank" title="" href="http://www.mono-project.com/CPlusPlus">IL-only C++ so it can run on Mono without Windows</a>.</li></ul><p>Contributions of Javascript and HTML must not rely on 3rd party services and must function only with services that the server can host itself.&nbsp; Try to stick with HTML that works in all browsers.&nbsp; Try not to use <a target="_blank" title="" href="http://code.google.com/chrome/chromeframe/">ChromeFrame</a> on static pages.<br></p><p>Please convert .gifs to .png before contributing them to ObjectCloud.&nbsp; Browser-based image editors don't like .gif.<br></p><p>Contributions of server-side C# code must not introduce and operating system or platform dependencies, nor must they require recompilation at deployment.<br></p><p>All contributions to ObjectCloud must be open-source and compatible with the various licenses that apply to ObjectCloud.&nbsp; Modifications to original ObjectCloud code must be the specific license that originally applied to the source code file or module..&nbsp; Modifications to code included with ObjectCloud must be mode in accordance with the original code license.&nbsp; Original submissions, such as javascript libraries and programs must be SimPL, Apache, GPL, LGPL, BSD, MIT, or Public Domain unless prior arrangement is made.</p><p>Furthermore, all contributions to ObjectCloud must be hostable by an ObjectCloud instance.&nbsp; For example, submissions that rely on 3rd party hosted services, such as Facebook Connect, are best kept as extensions to ObjectCloud.<br></p><p>To help out, contact me at:&nbsp; objectcloud&nbsp; (a t)&nbsp;&nbsp; andrewrondeau d0t com.</p><p><a href="about.page">About ObjectCloud</a></p>
