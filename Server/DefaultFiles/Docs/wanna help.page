{"Title":"Wanna help?","Contents":"<p><a href=\"about.page\">About ObjectCloud</a></p><p>ObjectCloud is currently very alpha, and help is appreciated. &#160;Listed below are various tasks that someone could take on:</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Forums</span>:&#160; I'd like some kind of forum system.&#160; For example, I'd like a .forum file to be an embedded database with a 1-topic forum.</li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Improve the blog</span>:&#160; The blog system is quite clunky.&#160; Can we make it better?</li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">IE Compatibility</span>:&#160;\nOnly minimal testing with IE is performed, and only at version 8.&#160; I'd\nlike to have \"good\" IE 7 &amp; 8 support, and rudimentary IE 6 support.<br/>\n</li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Canvaspaint</span>:&#160; I'd like\nCanvaspaint to have more of an ObjectCloud look &amp; feel.&#160; (It was a\nquick hack-in.)&#160; Specifically, I'd like it to look like Weco, Pears,\nand nicEdit.&#160; This means I'd like the paint area to size itself to the\nbrowser window, and I'd like to hide a lot of the author's comments.&#160; Some functionality, like text and polygons, is also missing.<br/></li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Some kind of componentized drop-down menu system</span>:&#160; The drop-down menu system in Canvaspaint looks cool.&#160; I'd like that abstracted out a bit so it can be reusable.</li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Code hosting</span>:&#160; Right now I use my personal (free) Perforce instance to host ObjectCloud.&#160; I'd like to move it to something like SourceForge.</li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Bug Tracking</span>:&#160; It would be cool if we had an ObjectCloud based bug tracker, but a free online bug tracker would be cool</li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Eye-candy</span>:&#160; Let's make ObjectCloud look as cool as possible</li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\"File Open\" and \"File Save\" dialogs</span>:&#160;\nWindows, Mac, and Linux all have generic File Open and Save dialogs\nthat are re-used by many applications.&#160; I'd like the same, with the\naddition of a \"File Upload\" dialog.</li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Multiple File Upload</span>:&#160;\nUpdate the directory viewer to add another &lt;input&gt; tag for\nanother file when the first one is specified.&#160; This will require\nworking with me to implement some server-modifications.<br/></li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">nicEdit improvements</span>:&#160; nicEdit.wchtml uses a <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://nicedit.com/\">Javascript-based HTML editor called nicEdit</a>.&#160; Some cool features that I'd like to integrate are:</li><ul><li>A way to browse the file system when adding a link or image</li><li>A way to directly upload images into the document.</li><li>A table editor would also be cool.</li><li>I'd also like to trap a lot of keystrokes like Apple-S,\nApple-B, Apple-I, and \"do\" what one would normally expect in a desktop\ndocument editor.</li></ul><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\"Magic\" .page transitions</span>:&#160; I'd like the .page viewer to find all links to other .page files.&#160; When such a link is clicked, I'd like the next page to be completely loaded through AJAX and the browser's URL refreshed.&#160; This would result in a faster load then if the entire .page file was reloaded and re-rendered in the browser.</li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Javascript without IKVM</span>:&#160; Specifically, ObjectCloud's Javascript environment uses <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/\">Rhino</a> running under <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://www.ikvm.net/\">IKVM</a>.&#160; This particular combination tends to cause lots of ugly crashes.&#160; In order to keep ObjectCloud platform independent; I'd like to stick with Rhino for the time being.&#160; An interesting technique that I'd like to explore is to call into Rhino by calling into Java through PInvoke instead of IKVM.&#160; Another more challenging technique would be to port <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://code.google.com/p/v8/\">V8</a> to <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://www.mono-project.com/CPlusPlus\">IL-only C++ so it can run on Mono without Windows</a>.</li></ul><p>Contributions of Javascript and HTML must not rely on 3rd party services and must function only with services that the server can host itself.&#160; Try to stick with HTML that works in all browsers.&#160; Try not to use <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://code.google.com/chrome/chromeframe/\">ChromeFrame</a> on static pages.<br/></p><p>Please convert .gifs to .png before contributing them to ObjectCloud.&#160; Browser-based image editors don't like .gif.<br/></p><p>Contributions of server-side C# code must not introduce and operating system or platform dependencies, nor must they require recompilation at deployment.<br/></p><p>All contributions to ObjectCloud must be open-source and compatible with the various licenses that apply to ObjectCloud.&#160; Modifications to original ObjectCloud code must be the specific license that originally applied to the source code file or module..&#160; Modifications to code included with ObjectCloud must be mode in accordance with the original code license.&#160; Original submissions, such as javascript libraries and programs must be SimPL, Apache, GPL, LGPL, BSD, MIT, or Public Domain unless prior arrangement is made.</p><p>Furthermore, all contributions to ObjectCloud must be hostable by an ObjectCloud instance.&#160; For example, submissions that rely on 3rd party hosted services, such as Facebook Connect, are best kept as extensions to ObjectCloud.<br/></p><p>To help out, contact me at:&#160; objectcloud&#160; (a t)&#160;&#160;
