{"Title":"Wanna help?","Contents":"\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"about.page\">About ObjectCloud\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>ObjectCloud is currently very alpha, and help is appreciated. &nbsp;Listed below are various tasks that someone could take on:\u003C/p>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Forums\u003C/span>:&nbsp; I'd like some kind of forum system.&nbsp; For example, I'd like a .forum file to be an embedded database with a 1-topic forum.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Improve the blog\u003C/span>:&nbsp; The blog system is quite clunky.&nbsp; Can we make it better?\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: bold;\">IE Compatibility\u003C/span>:&nbsp;\nOnly minimal testing with IE is performed, and only at version 8.&nbsp; I'd\nlike to have \"good\" IE 7 &amp; 8 support, and rudimentary IE 6 support.\u003Cbr>\n\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Canvaspaint\u003C/span>:&nbsp; I'd like\nCanvaspaint to have more of an ObjectCloud look &amp; feel.&nbsp; (It was a\nquick hack-in.)&nbsp; Specifically, I'd like it to look like Weco, Pears,\nand nicEdit.&nbsp; This means I'd like the paint area to size itself to the\nbrowser window, and I'd like to hide a lot of the author's comments.&nbsp; Some functionality, like text and polygons, is also missing.\u003Cbr>\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Some kind of componentized drop-down menu system\u003C/span>:&nbsp; The drop-down menu system in Canvaspaint looks cool.&nbsp; I'd like that abstracted out a bit so it can be reusable.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Code hosting\u003C/span>:&nbsp; Right now I use my personal (free) Perforce instance to host ObjectCloud.&nbsp; I'd like to move it to something like SourceForge.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Bug Tracking\u003C/span>:&nbsp; It would be cool if we had an ObjectCloud based bug tracker, but a free online bug tracker would be cool\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Eye-candy\u003C/span>:&nbsp; Let's make ObjectCloud look as cool as possible\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\"File Open\" and \"File Save\" dialogs\u003C/span>:&nbsp;\nWindows, Mac, and Linux all have generic File Open and Save dialogs\nthat are re-used by many applications.&nbsp; I'd like the same, with the\naddition of a \"File Upload\" dialog.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Multiple File Upload\u003C/span>:&nbsp;\nUpdate the directory viewer to add another &lt;input&gt; tag for\nanother file when the first one is specified.&nbsp; This will require\nworking with me to implement some server-modifications.\u003Cbr>\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: bold;\">nicEdit improvements\u003C/span>:&nbsp; nicEdit.wchtml uses a \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://nicedit.com/\">Javascript-based HTML editor called nicEdit\u003C/a>.&nbsp; Some cool features that I'd like to integrate are:\u003C/li>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>A way to browse the file system when adding a link or image\u003C/li>\u003Cli>A way to directly upload images into the document.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>A table editor would also be cool.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>I'd also like to trap a lot of keystrokes like Apple-S,\nApple-B, Apple-I, and \"do\" what one would normally expect in a desktop\ndocument editor.\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\"Magic\" .page transitions\u003C/span>:&nbsp; I'd like the .page viewer to find all links to other .page files.&nbsp; When such a link is clicked, I'd like the next page to be completely loaded through AJAX and the browser's URL refreshed.&nbsp; This would result in a faster load then if the entire .page file was reloaded and re-rendered in the browser.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Javascript without IKVM\u003C/span>:&nbsp; Specifically, ObjectCloud's Javascript environment uses \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/\">Rhino\u003C/a> running under \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://www.ikvm.net/\">IKVM\u003C/a>.&nbsp; This particular combination tends to cause lots of ugly crashes.&nbsp; In order to keep ObjectCloud platform independent; I'd like to stick with Rhino for the time being.&nbsp; An interesting technique that I'd like to explore is to call into Rhino by calling into Java through PInvoke instead of IKVM.&nbsp; Another more challenging technique would be to port \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://code.google.com/p/v8/\">V8\u003C/a> to \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://www.mono-project.com/CPlusPlus\">IL-only C++ so it can run on Mono without Windows\u003C/a>.\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003Cp>Contributions of Javascript and HTML must not rely on 3rd party services and must function only with services that the server can host itself.&nbsp; Try to stick with HTML that works in all browsers.&nbsp; Try not to use \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://code.google.com/chrome/chromeframe/\">ChromeFrame\u003C/a> on static pages.\u003Cbr>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Please convert .gifs to .png before contributing them to ObjectCloud.&nbsp; Browser-based image editors don't like .gif.\u003Cbr>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Contributions of server-side C# code must not introduce and operating system or platform dependencies, nor must they require recompilation at deployment.\u003Cbr>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>All contributions to ObjectCloud must be open-source and compatible with the various licenses that apply to ObjectCloud.&nbsp; Modifications to original ObjectCloud code must be the specific license that originally applied to the source code file or module..&nbsp; Modifications to code included with ObjectCloud must be mode in accordance with the original code license.&nbsp; Original submissions, such as javascript libraries and programs must be SimPL, Apache, GPL, LGPL, BSD, MIT, or Public Domain unless prior arrangement is made.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Furthermore, all contributions to ObjectCloud must be hostable by an ObjectCloud instance.&nbsp; For example, submissions that rely on 3rd party hosted services, such as Facebook Connect, are best kept as extensions to ObjectCloud.\u003Cbr>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>To help out, contact me at:&nbsp; objectcloud&nbsp;
