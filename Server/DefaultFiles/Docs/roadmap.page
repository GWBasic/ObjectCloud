{"Title":"ObjectCloud and Particle Roadmap","Contents":"\n<p>This page describes the roadmap for ObjectCloud. At this time, the general timeline and expected completion dates are unknown.</p><h1>Short-Term</h1><p>The following tasks are what Andrew will implement in the&#160;foreseeable&#160;future.</p><h3>Multi-tenant support</h3><p>Multi-tenant support allows a single ObjectCloud server at a single IP to handle multiple instances with unique domain names.</p><h2>UI improvements</h2><p>After multi-tenant support is implemented, Andrew will investigate some simple UI improvements.</p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><h2>Uploads and Images</h2><p>Users need an easy way to upload images and have them show up in other people's feeds. Likewise, video and MP3s support is also needed.</p><h2><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-size: medium; \"></span>\"Free\" instances</h2><p>Once multi-tenant support is implemented, Andrew will investigate providing free ObjectCloud instances to the general public.</p><h2>Additional applications</h2><p>After providing free ObjectCloud instances, Andrew will investigate providing some additional applications beyond what's part of the default ObjectCloud installation.</p><h1>Longer-term roadmap</h1><h2>Distributed and Federated Social Networking</h2><p>Distributed and Federated Social Networking is still in its infancy. ObjectCloud will keep up-to-date on these protocols and implement on an as-needed basis.</p><p>Its particle protocol will most likely remain unimproved for the&#160;foreseeable&#160;future.</p><h2>Automatic Updates</h2><p>ObjectCloud needs to support automatic updates so that system administrators are not burdened with the tedium of manually updating each time a new feature or bugfix is implemented.</p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><h2>API Improvements</h2><p>Currently, ObjectCloud's Javascript API works best when used within the templating system. Andrew's considering an improved version of ObjectCloud's API that takes advantage of jQuery when used from ordinary HTML and Javascript.</p><h2>OpenID Improvements and WebFinger</h2><p>WebFinger is an extension to OpenID that lets people use an email address as a globally-unique identifier. Given that people generally understand and recognize email addresses, this is a preferred way of identifying people.</p><p>ObjectCloud's OpenID implementation is primarily tested against itself. Currently, it's known to be&#160;buggy and unreliable. This needs general improvement and verification against well-known OpenID services.</p><h1><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size: 24px; \">Profiles</span></h1><p>ObjectCloud needs a light exchange of profile information so that people can appear with real names.</p><p></p><h2>Friendship and Followers</h2><p>ObjectCloud currently doesn't have a concept of friendship and followers.</p><h2>Groups</h2><p>There are many different ways to implement groups. Currently, ObjectCloud groups are a shortcut to assign many users a permission to many things.</p><h2>Events and Calendars</h2><p>Events will most likely have a documentType of \"event\" or \"invitation,\" and have scheduling information in the changeData. ObjectCloud will need a concept of a user's calendar.</p><h2>Hierarchies</h2><p>Important people designated by ObjectCloud server administers should be able to put things in all local users' feeds. This more naturally follows human leadership patterns, and is useful for when an ObjectCloud instance revolves around a civic group.</p><h1></h1><h1><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size: 24px; \">Encryption</span></h1><p style=\"font-weight: normal; font-size: medium; \">The current design in ObjectCloud is secure in that it's designed to prevent the spoofing problem commonly found in email. It's insecure in that the ObjectCloud reference implementation does not use any form of encryption, such as SSL.&#160;This means that a user on WiFi can have his or her credentials stolen; and that a&#160;malicious&#160;ISP can impersonate a known ObjectCloud user.</p><p style=\"font-weight: normal; font-size: medium; \">This most likely will be addressed by requiring SSL at all points, both for server to server communication, and client to server communication. &#160;SSL is \"easy\" to bolt on to a server by using STunnel, although it's currently not used because SSL has certain implementation difficulties and complexities.</p><p>&#160;</p>"}
