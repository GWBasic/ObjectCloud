{"Title":"ObjectCloud and Particle Roadmap","Contents":"\n<p>This page describes the roadmap for both ObjectCloud and the Particle specification development. &#160;At this time, the timeline is unknown. &#160;Items are listed in the anticipated order of completion</p><h1>Mechanics</h1><h2>Automatic Updates</h2><p>ObjectCloud needs to support automatic updates so that system administrators are not burdened with the tedium of manually updating each time a new feature or bugfix is implemented.</p><h2>OpenID Improvements and WebFinger</h2><p>WebFinger is an extension to OpenID that lets people use an email address as a globally-unique identifier. &#160;Given that people generally understand and recognize email addresses, this is a preferred way of identifying people.</p><p>ObjectCloud's OpenID implementation is primarily tested against itself. &#160;Currently, it's known to be&#160;buggy and unreliable. &#160;This needs general improvement and verification against well-known OpenID services.</p><h1>Features</h1><h2>Profiles</h2><p>ObjectCloud and the Particle protocol need a light exchange of profile information so that people can appear with real names.</p><p></p><h2>Friendship and Followers</h2><p>The protocol currently doesn't have a concept of friendship and followers. &#160;Even though the protocol eliminates the spoofing problem found in email, it still lets anyone send notifications to anyone.</p><p>A concept of friendship and followers is needed so that peoples' feeds are filtered to only information from known and trusted sources.</p><h2>Uploads and Images</h2><p>People need an easy way to upload images and have them show up in other people's feeds. Likewise, video and MP3s support is also needed.</p><p></p><h2>Groups</h2><p>There are many different ways to implement groups. Currently, ObjectCloud groups are a shortcut to assign many users a permission to many things.</p><h2>Events and Calendars</h2><p>Events will most likely have a documentType of \"event\" or \"invitation,\" and have scheduling information in the changeData. ObjectCloud will need a concept of a user's calendar.</p><h2>Hierarchies</h2><p>Important people designated by ObjectCloud server administers should be able to put things in all local users' feeds. This more naturally follows human leadership patterns, and is useful for when an ObjectCloud instance revolves around a civic group.</p><h1></h1><h1>Security and Scalability</h1><h2>Encryption</h2><p style=\"font-weight: normal; font-size: medium; \">The current design in Particle is secure in that it's designed to prevent the spoofing problem commonly found in email. It's insecure in that the ObjectCloud reference implementation does not use any form of encryption, such as SSL.&#160;This means that a user on WiFi can have his or her credentials stolen; and that a&#160;malicious&#160;ISP can impersonate a known ObjectCloud user.</p><p style=\"font-weight: normal; font-size: medium; \">This most likely will be addressed by requiring SSL at all points, both for server to server communication, and client to server communication. &#160;SSL is \"easy\" to bolt on to a server by using STunnel, although it's currently not used because SSL has certain implementation difficulties and complexities.</p><p>&#160;</p>"}
