{"Title":"Creating a Blog or Forum","Contents":"\n<p><a href=\"about.page\">About ObjectCloud</a></p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Note</span>: &#160;<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Blogs and forums are very experimental in this release of ObjectCloud</span>.<br/></p><p>ObjectCloud lets you control who can read a blog or a forum, and who can reply to posts.&#160; In ObjectCloud, blogs and forums are the same kind of file, a blogum.&#160; Depending on who has permission to post, the blogum will behave more like a blog or more like a forum.<br/></p><h1>Creating the Blogum</h1><p>Navigate to the folder where you\nwould like to place the Blogum.&#160; Go to \"New File,\" select \"Blogum,\" and enter the file name.&#160; (For example, in the <a target=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"walkthrough.page\">Walkthrough</a>, we created \"new file.page\" in the /Users/root folder.)</p><h1>Setting Permissions</h1><p>As the owner of the blogum, you need to decide who can read the blogum, who can administer it, who can add new posts to the blogum, and who can reply to existing posts.</p><h2>Setting who can read and who can administer the blogum</h2><p>Click on the drop-down menu next to the blogum's file name, and select \"Permissions\".</p><p>On this page, everyone who you add with \"Read\" permission can read the blogum.&#160; For example, if you add \"everybody\" with \"Read\" permission, everyone on the public internet will be able to read the blogum.&#160; If you add \"localusers\" with read permission, only people with an account on the server will be able to read the blogum.&#160; You can also add specific user names or open IDs and grant them permission to read the blogum.<br/></p><p>To allow someone to administer the blogum, give that person \"Administer\" permission.&#160; You can give \"Administer\" permission to an OpenID.</p><h2>Setting who can post to the blogum and who can reply to posts</h2><p>Fundamentally, the difference between a blog and a forum is permissions.&#160; On a blog, a single person or a small group of people make posts that the general public, or a larger group of people, read and reply to.&#160; On a forum, anyone can make a post, and anyone can reply to the post.&#160; For this reason, ObjectCloud does not distinguish between blogs and forums.</p><p>To make the blogum behave like a forum, under \"Give a user, group, or OpenId permission to post,\" give permission to \"everybody\", \"authenticatedusers\", or \"localusers.\"&#160; You can also choose to give a select few people permission to post to your blog by giving a user or OpenID permission to post.</p><p>If you'd prefer to use your blogum like a personal blog, simply ignore \"Give a user, group, or OpenId permission to post.\"</p><p>After deciding who has permission to create posts on the blogum, you must decide who can reply to posts on the blogum.&#160; Under \"Give a user, group, or OpenId permission to reply,\" add \"everybody\" to allow anyone to reply, even if they choose to be anonymous.&#160; Add \"authenticatedusers\" to allow anyone to reply, even if they use OpenID.&#160; Use \"localusers\" to only allow people with accounts on the ObjectCloud server to reply.&#160; You can also use a specific list of users or OpenIDs if you'd prefer to keep a more closed blogum.<br/></p><h1>Adding a Post</h1><p>The easiest way to add a post to the blogum is to view it.&#160; A rich text editor will appear at the top that lets you enter a post without leaving the blogum.&#160; This is visible to all users who you've granted permission to post.</p><p>It's also possible to post any file that is in the same directory as the blogum.&#160; This is useful if a file is an image or other document type, or if you'd prefer to work on a .page file in private before publishing it.&#160; To do so, edit the blogum and type in the file name under \"Add a post.\"</p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Note</span>:&#160; <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Images and other file types might not support replying or other interactive discussions.</span><br/></p><a href=\"about.page\">About ObjectCloud</a>"}
