{"Title":"FAQ","Contents":"\n<p>This is ObjectCloud's FAQ, for frequently asked, and anticipated, questions.</p><h1>General</h1><h2>What Can I Do With ObjectCloud?</h2><p>ObjectCloud is designed for today's social computing needs. It allows you to interact with anyone much like in popular social networks.</p><h2>How Can I get an Account?</h2><p>To use ObjectCloud, you must either run your own ObjectCloud server, or know someone else who runs an ObjectCloud server.</p><p>If you are logged in as root or a system&#160;administrator, click on \"Change User\" in the upper-right of this page to get to the&#160;<a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"/DefaultTemplate/createaccount.oc\">Create Account</a>&#160;page. You can grant general users permission to create accounts on this page if you wish.</p><h2>Can I have friends, groups, followers, and events? Profiles? Share photos, music, and videos?</h2><p>These features are on the <a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"/Docs/roadmap.page\">roadmap</a>.</p><h2>What&#160;License&#160;Is ObjectCloud Released Under?</h2><p>See the <a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"/Docs/license.oc\">license</a>&#160;page.</p><h2>Is there a blog?</h2><p><a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"http://objectcloud.kicks-ass.net\">We run an ObjectCloud blog on the alpha server at http://objectcloud.kicks-ass.net</a>. Please keep in mind that the alpha server may experience unplanned downtime.</p><h2>Where can I download ObjectCloud?</h2><p><a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"http://objectcloud.com\">ObjectCloud, and its source code, is at http://objectcloud.com</a>.</p><h2>Is there a jQuery plugin?</h2><p>We've been asked for this and it's on the <a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"/Docs/roadmap.page\">roadmap</a>.</p><h2>Is there any ObjectCloud merchandise?</h2><p>We have an <a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"http://www.printfection.com/ObjectCloud\">ObjectCloud merchandise store</a>.</p><h1>Security</h1><h2>What Kind of Permissions are Supported?</h2><p>ObjectCloud has a rich permission system based around read, write, and administer access to objects, which are&#160;analogous&#160;to files. This is inspired from the permission models found in Unix and Windows.&#160;In addition, ObjectCloud allows assigning permissions based on actions to objects. For example, you can grant users permission to \"reply\" to a page without giving general write permission.</p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><h2>How secure is ObjectCloud?</h2><p>Permissions are enforced at a special security layer. This makes it difficult for low level operations to accidentally not have permissions enforced.</p><p>Security is a major design priority in ObjectCloud, now and in the future.</p><p><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; \">Are there automatic updates?</span></p><p>This feature is on the <a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"/Docs/roadmap.page\">roadmap</a>.</p><h2>Is encryption or SSL supported?</h2><p>SSL is on the <a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"/Docs/roadmap.page\">roadmap</a>.&#160;In general, SSL is needed to prevent session theft, casual WiFi snooping, sniffing, ect.</p><p>Because SSL can be bolted onto existing servers using tools like stunnel, we've focused on the lower-level security design and implementation.</p><p><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; \">If SSL is so easy to implement, why isn't it set up, required and turned on by default?</span></p><p>A design philosophy is that it must be easy to test-drive ObjectCloud.</p><p>SSL requires special configuration through unique security certificates in each&#160;installation. This configuration process&#160;can be confusing for newcomers. Setting up a system for free and/or automatically configured certificates could result in a comprised SSL security certificate, or difficulties with casual and academic experimentation.</p><p>Future versions of ObjectCloud may require properly-configured SSL to operate on the public internet, but relax this restriction on private networks.</p><h2>How Can I add SSL?</h2><p>The usual way is with stunnel, however, ObjectCloud must be updated to direct the browser to use https instead of http. As of now, this approach is untested.</p><h2>Isn't it dangerous to have \"root\" as the default password?</h2><p>Yes it is, and you should <a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"/DefaultTemplate/usermanager.oc?Target=/Users/root.user\">change it right now</a>.</p><p>Jokes aside, we want an easy way to experiment. If you'd like to change the password prior to putting ObjectCloud on the internet, use the following command:</p><p><b>Linux / Mac</b></p><blockquote class=\"webkit-indent-blockquote\" style=\"margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;\"><p>mono ObjectCloud.exe rootpassword [your new password]</p></blockquote><p><b>Windows</b></p><blockquote class=\"webkit-indent-blockquote\" style=\"margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;\"><p></p><p>ObjectCloud rootpassword [your new password]</p></blockquote><h2>Does ObjectCloud ever call home?</h2><p>Yes, ObjectCloud calls home every hour or so. We keep this data so we can maintain statistics about how many servers are running. The call home logic only tracks hostname, call home time, and a version information. It is only enabled when the host name is configured and normally will not activate for casual experimentation.</p><p>You can disable calling home in ObjectCloudConfig.xml, but please don't. Our&#160;statistics&#160;help us track adoption, and are used so we can list all publicly-accessible ObjectCloud servers.</p><p>You can see what's being tracked in the source code. &#160;See Server/ObjectCloud/CallHome.cs for the code that each server runs. &#160;See Server/ObjectCloud.CallHomePlugin/ for our plugin that handles and tracks this data.</p><h2>Why does the background turn red when I log in as root?</h2><p>It turns red to warn you that you're root and can do some serious damage to the ObjectCloud installation. In general, you should use ObjectCloud as an ordinary user and only log in as root to perform system administration tasks.</p><h2>Why do I need to Confirm replies?</h2><p>This is a security feature, and it's intended to prevent spammers from using your name to endorse their h3rb@l v1@gr@. ObjectCloud allows you to trust servers, so you only need to confirm other servers once.</p><h1>Technical</h1><h2>Can I Use my own HTML Editor?</h2><p>Yes, although it depends on what you're trying to create and how many of our components you're trying to use.</p><p>For general application development that uses our Javascript APIs, you should try to&#160;separate&#160;presentation and logic. (Keep Javascript out of HTML.)</p><p>If you'd like to use our components, your editor will need to generate valid xhtml. You will need to manually edit the HTML to call our components.</p><p>If you're generating a complete look and feel for ObjectCloud, you'll need to manually edit the resulting page to use our login component and have an empty &lt;oc:component /&gt; tag.</p><h2>How Scalable is ObjectCloud?</h2><p>ObjectCloud is designed so that a single instance can handle a small group of users. The distributed nature of ObjectCloud means that there can be an&#160;infinite&#160;number of ObjectCloud servers on the public internet, much like how email grows.</p><p>ObjectCloud's modular nature allows plugins that are designed to handle a much higher load, although such a server may require a more knowledgable system&#160;administrator&#160;and database administration.</p><p><a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"http://appfeeds.com/\">AppFeeds</a>&#160;is currently developing a proprietary version of ObjectCloud that will handle business-class load.</p><h2>What Browsers does ObjectCloud support?</h2><p>We try to be as browser-neutral as possible, although supporting Internet Explorer can be difficult at times. While we would like to be 100% compatible with all major browsers, Internet Explorer users may find that some things run better when ChromeFrame is installed.</p><p>If you run across a browser incompatibility, please drop a line on&#160;<a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/objectcloud\">http://groups.google.com/group/objectcloud</a>&#160;and we'll do our best to fix it.</p><h2>What are ObjectCloud's requirements?</h2><p>ObjectCloud requires no database or complicated server set up. It runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac without recompilation. See the <a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"/Docs/requirements.page\">requirements</a>&#160;for more information.</p><h2>Is there an installer to run ObjectCloud as a service</h2><p>At this point there is no installer. &#160;Just run ObjectCloud.exe.</p><h2>Is there a Mac Distribution?</h2><p>At this time ObjectCloud requires Mono. &#160;Once Mono is installed, you can run ObjectCloud from the terminal.</p><h2>Is there a Linux Distribution?</h2><p>No, however ObjectCloud runs without recompilation once a recent version of Mono is installed.&#160;&#160;Some Linux distros come with an old version of Mono, thus you may need to download and build the most recent Mono distribution.</p><p>Once a recent version of Mono is installed, you can run ObjectCloud from the shell.</p><h2>How Easy is it to put ObjectCloud on the public Internet?</h2><p>ObjectCloud has some additional settings that need to be tuned prior to placing it on the public internet, these are in a single xml configuration file. &#160;Configuring ObjectCloud to run on the public internet involves specifying a port, hostname, and RAM cache limits.</p><p>For more information, see the <a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"/Docs/walkthrough.page\">walkthrough</a>&#160;and guide to <a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"/Docs/public_internet.page\">putting ObjectCloud on the public internet</a>.</p><h2>What Kind of Back-End does ObjectCloud use?</h2><p>ObjectCloud is its own server, it does not run under Apache or IIS. &#160;It uses a combination of flat files and SQlite for data&#160;persistence. &#160;This is to keep development and deployment complexity to a minimum.</p><p>It is possible to move ObjectCloud to another database; its data access layer is well abstracted and modular. &#160;(For example, there is a proprietary plugin in development that runs against <a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"http://www.mongodb.org/\">MongoDB</a>.)</p><h2>Can ObjectCloud Run as a plug-in for Apache or IIS?</h2><p>At this time there are no plans to run under Apache or IIS, although these kinds of arrangements could be supported in the future based on demand.</p><p>This approach is similar to how Ruby on Rails originally required a web server written in Ruby.</p><h2>How Customizable is ObjectCloud?</h2><p>Everything you see on ObjectCloud can be customized using ObjectCloud's xml + HTML 5 templating system. &#160;You are free to have a social network that has your own look and feel.</p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><h2>I've hosed my ObjectCloud setup? How can I restore it?</h2><p>You can restore ObjectCloud at the command-line. Keep in mind that restoring ObjectCloud this way will keep user data, but will destroy most custom templates and Javascript We suggest copying the FileSystem folder in ObjectCloud.exe's directory in case you want to undo the restore.</p><p>After shutting down ObjectCloud, use the following command:</p><p><b>Linux / Mac</b></p><blockquote class=\"webkit-indent-blockquote\" style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 40px; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-width: initial; border-color: initial; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; \"><p>mono ObjectCloud.exe restoresystem</p></blockquote><p><b>Windows</b></p><blockquote class=\"webkit-indent-blockquote\" style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 40px; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-width: initial; border-color: initial; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; \"><p></p></blockquote><blockquote class=\"webkit-indent-blockquote\" style=\"margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;\"><p>ObjectCloud&#160;restoresystem</p></blockquote><h2><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-size: medium; \"></span>What is developing with ObjectCloud Like?</h2><p>ObjectCloud is designed like an operating system. &#160;Its entire API is available through HTTP / REST. &#160;The API is automatically wrapped for easy use from in-browser Javascript, server-side Javascript, and Node.js.</p><p>For simple applications, no server-side programming is needed as all data access can be performed by calling ObjectCloud's APIs directly from in-browser Javascript.</p><h2>What Language is ObjectCloud written in?</h2><p>ObjectCloud is written in C# and Javascript. &#160;It runs and compiles under both .Net and Mono. &#160;ObjectCloud has its own HTTP framework, it handles its own sockets at the TCP layer.</p><p>C# was chosen because its operator overloading support allows ObjectCloud to use a kick-ass ORM system, and because Garbage Collection is a vital feature. &#160;Furthermore, we believes that the lowest level parts of an operating system need to be fully compiled to eliminate syntax errors and perform as much type checking as possible.</p><p>C# allows ObjectCloud to be built in a manner where a single build works flawlessly on Windows, Mac, and Linux.</p><p>C / C++ is avoided because manual memory management and recompiling for every operating system under the sun isn't cool. C#, although garbage collected, lets us optimize with manual memory management when needed.</p><p>Although Java was initially explored, it was abandoned because it doesn't support operator overloading.</p><h2>Why Does ObjectCloud use its own HTTP layer instead of the many other HTTP libraries and servers?</h2><p>The original motivation for creating yet another HTTP layer came from <a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak\">Steve Wozniak's</a>&#160;\"close to the metal\" philosophy. &#160;HTTP is simple and flexible enough that working with HTTP at the socket layer allows for features like Comet that might be difficult in libraries or APIs that have a more restrictive view of what an application can do with HTTP.</p><p>C#'s HttpListener was avoided for two reasons. In early development, Andrew encountered some incompatibilities between .Net and Mono's HttpListener. &#160;In addition, Windows now requires some rather complicated security configurations in order for an application to use HttpListener.</p><p>Plugging into a server like Apache was avoided because working with a C API is complicated in a world without pointers and manual memory management.</p><p>IIS was avoided because it adds too many abstractions over \"how the web works.\"</p><p>Because of this situation, it's possible to just run ObjectCloud.exe, point a browser to localhost, and play with ObjectCloud. &#160;Other situations that would use HttpListener, IIS, or Apache, would require additional configuration.</p><p>Because ObjectCloud is very modular, it's <i>theoretically</i> possible to create a way to plug it into Apache or IIS. There are no plans to create such a module, but these kinds of arrangements could be supported in the future based on demand.</p><h2>Why does ObjectCloud always redirect me to my server's IP instead of its domain?</h2><p>In order for OpenID to work correctly, ObjectCloud must be aware of its domain. This is specified in ObjectCloudConfig.xml. When the domain isn't specified in ObjectCloudConfig.xml, ObjectCloud uses its IP as its host name.</p><p>By default, ObjectCloud always redirects requests to the host name that it expects. &#160;Thus, if you haven't configured ObjectCloudConfig.xml with the expected host name, it will redirect you to its IP.</p><h2>What Javascript engine does ObjectCloud use for server-side Javascript?</h2><p><a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/\">Mozilla Rhino</a>, a java-based Javascript environment. We chose Rhino because we want ObjectCloud to run anywhere without recompilation. For&#160;stability&#160;reasons, Rhino is hosted in a sub process that can be restarted in the event that poorly-written Javascript crashes. Per ObjectCloud's modular design, Rhino can be replaced with another Javascript engine.</p><h2>Why didn't you choose (my favorite Javascript engine)?</h2><p>Spidermonkey and V8 require specific compilation for each target operating system. Unlike SQLite, there is no set of platform-independent&#160;C# APIs for these engines.</p><p>The various .Net Javascript engines from Microsoft are deprecated.</p><p>We originally experimented with converting Rhino to a .Net dll through IKVM, but this approach proved slow and unstable.</p><p>We experimented with <a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"http://jint.codeplex.com/\">Jint</a>, a .Net Javascript interpreter. At the time, it didn't support enough of Javascript to be a viable option.</p><p><a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"http://nodejs.org/\">Node.js</a>&#160;is appealing, but doesn't provide isolated contexts, and it allows too much access to the underlying computer.</p><h2>Is IP v6 supported?</h2><p>No at the moment. Please contact <a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"http://appfeeds.com\">AppFeeds</a>&#160;if IP v6 support is needed. Motivated parties may look at&#160;/Server/ObjectCloud.WebServer.Implementation/WebServer.cs&#160;in the source code.</p><h1>Community</h1><h2>Is there a Mailing List?</h2><p>For support, visit&#160;<a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/objectcloud\">http://groups.google.com/group/objectcloud</a>.</p><h2>How Can I Contribute?</h2><p>See <a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"/Docs/contributing.page\">Contributing to ObjectCloud</a>.</p><h2>I found a bug</h2><p>Please send an email to the mailing list.
