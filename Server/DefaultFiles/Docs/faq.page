{"Title":"FAQ","Contents":"\n<p>This is ObjectCloud's FAQ, for frequently asked, and anticipated, questions.</p><h1>General</h1><h2>What Can I Do With ObjectCloud?</h2><h2>How Can I get an Account?</h2><p>To use ObjectCloud, you must either run your own ObjectCloud server, or know someone else who runs an ObjectCloud server.</p><p>At this time, there is no official timeline for sites that are open to the general public, although we would like to get such a service running.</p><h2>What&#160;License&#160;Is ObjectCloud Released Under?</h2><p>ObjectCloud is released under the&#160;<a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"http://opensource.org/licenses/simpl-2.0.html\"><font class=\"Apple-style-span\" color=\"#000000\">SimPL 2.0</font></a>&#160;license with generous terms for proprietary plugins.</p><p>We chose the SimPL&#160;license&#160;because it is written in terms that are easy to understand and isn't preachy. &#160;Prior to SimPL, we used LGPL. &#160;The \"lesser,\" or \"library,\" aspect of the LGPL is retained so that proprietary plugins can implement ObjectCloud interfaces, inherit from ObjectCloud classes, and be loaded as plugins and/or through&#160;dependency&#160;injection. &#160;This allows proprietary low-level extensions to ObjectCloud while still keeping the core free and open to all.&#160;</p><p>See&#160;<a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"http://172.16.3.1:1080/Docs/license.oc\"><font class=\"Apple-style-span\" color=\"#000000\">License</font></a>&#160;for more information.</p><h1>Security</h1><p>TODO</p><h1>Technical</h1><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><h2>How Scalable is ObjectCloud?</h2><p>ObjectCloud is designed so that a single instance can handle a small group of users. &#160;The distributed nature of ObjectCloud means that there can be an&#160;infinite&#160;number of ObjectCloud servers on the public internet, much like how email grows.</p><p>ObjectCloud's modular nature allows plugins that are designed to handle a much higher load, although such a server may require a more knowledgable system&#160;administrator&#160;and database administration.</p><p><a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"http://appfeeds.com/\">AppFeeds</a>&#160;is currently developing a proprietary version of ObjectCloud that will handle business-class load.</p><h2>What Browsers does ObjectCloud support?</h2><p>We try to be as browser-neutral as possible, although supporting Internet Explorer can be difficult at times. &#160;While we would like to be 100% compatible with all major browsers, Internet Explorer users may find that some things run better when ChromeFrame is installed.</p><p>If you run across a browser incompatibility, please drop a line on&#160;<a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/objectcloud\">http://groups.google.com/group/objectcloud</a>&#160;and we'll do our best to fix it.</p><h2>What are ObjectCloud's requirements?</h2><p>ObjectCloud requires no database or complicated server set up.</p><p>On Windows, ObjectCloud has no requirements. &#160;Just download and run ObjectCloud.exe.</p><p>On Mac and Linux, ObjectCloud requires a recent version of Mono.</p><h2>Is there an installer to run ObjectCloud as a service</h2><p>At this point there is no installer. &#160;Just run ObjectCloud.exe.</p><h2>Is there a Mac Distribution?</h2><p>At this time ObjectCloud requires Mono. &#160;Once Mono is installed, you can run ObjectCloud from the terminal.</p><h2>Is there a Linux Distribution?</h2><p>No, however ObjectCloud runs as-is once a recent version of Mono is installed.&#160;&#160;Some Linux distros come with an old version of Mono, thus you may need to download and build the most recent Mono distribution.</p><h2>How Easy is it to put ObjectCloud on the public Internet?</h2><p>ObjectCloud has some additional settings that need to be tuned prior to placing it on the public internet, these are in a single xml configuration file. &#160;Configuring ObjectCloud to run on the public internet involves specifying a port, hostname, and RAM cache limits.</p><p>For more information, see the <a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"/Docs/walkthrough.page\">walkthrough</a>&#160;and guide to <a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"/Docs/public_internet.page\">putting ObjectCloud on the public internet</a>.</p><h2>What Kind of Back-End does ObjectCloud use?</h2><p>ObjectCloud is its own server, it does not run under Apache or IIS. &#160;It uses a combination of flat files and SQlite for data&#160;persistence. &#160;This is to keep development and deployment complexity to a minimum.</p><p>It is possible to move ObjectCloud to another database; its data access layer is well abstracted and modular. &#160;(For example, there is a proprietary plugin in development that runs against Mongo.)</p><h2>Can ObjectCloud Run as a plug-in for Apache or IIS?</h2><p>At this time there are no plans to run under Apache or IIS, although these kinds of arrangements could be supported in the future based on demand.</p><h2>How Customizable is ObjectCloud?</h2><p>Everything you see on ObjectCloud can be customized using ObjectCloud's xml + HTML 5 templating system. &#160;You are free to have a social network that has your own look and feel.</p><h2>What is developing with ObjectCloud Like?</h2><p>ObjectCloud is designed like an operating system. &#160;Its entire API is available through HTTP / REST. &#160;The API is automatically wrapped for easy use from in-browser Javascript, server-side Javascript, and Node.js.</p><p>For simple applications, no server-side programming is needed as all data access can be performed by calling ObjectCloud's APIs directly from in-browser Javascript.</p><h2>What Language is ObjectCloud written in?</h2><p>ObjectCloud is written in C# and Javascript. &#160;It runs and compiles under both .Net and Mono. &#160;ObjectCloud has its own HTTP framework, it handles its own sockets at the TCP layer.</p><p>C# was chosen because its operator overloading support allows ObjectCloud to use a kick-ass ORM system, and because Garbage Collection is a vital feature. &#160;Furthermore, Andrew believes that the lowest level parts of an operating system need to be fully compiled to eliminate syntax errors perform as much type checking as possible.</p><p>C# allows ObjectCloud to be built in a manner where a single build works flawlessly on Windows, Mac, and Linux.</p><p>C / C++ was avoided because manual memory management and recompiling for every operating system under the sun isn't cool.</p><p>Although Java was initially explored, it was abandoned because it doesn't support operator overloading.</p><h2>Why Does ObjectCloud use its own HTTP layer instead of the many other HTTP libraries and servers?</h2><p>The original motivation for creating yet another HTTP layer came from <a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak\">Steve Wozniak's</a>&#160;\"close to the metal\" philosophy. &#160;HTTP is simple and flexible that working with HTTP at the socket layer allows for features like Comet that might be difficult in libraries or APIs that have a more restrictive view of what an application can do with HTTP.</p><p>C#'s HttpListener was avoided for two reasons. &#160;Andrew encountered some incompatibilities between .Net and Mono's HttpListener. &#160;In addition, Windows now requires some rather complicated security configurations in order for an application to use HttpListener.</p><p>Plugging into a server like Apache was avoided because working with a C API is complicated in a world without pointers and manual memory management.</p><p>IIS was avoided because it adds too many abstractions over \"how the web works.\"</p><p>Because ObjectCloud is very modular, it's <i>theoretically</i> possible to create a way to plug it into Apache or IIS. &#160;There are no plans to implement such a module at this time.</p><h1>Community</h1><h2>Is there a Mailing List?</h2><p>For support, visit&#160;<a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/objectcloud\">http://groups.google.com/group/objectcloud</a>.</p><h2>How Can I Contribute?</h2><p>Send an email to gwbasic - at - appfeeds - dot - com. &#160;Please note that source code submissions require assigning all copyright to Andrew Rondeau, unless prior arrangements were made.</p><h2>I found a bug. &#160;You suck!</h2><p>Welcome to alpha software!
