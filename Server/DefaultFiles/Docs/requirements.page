Mozilla and Chrome on Macintosh are the most tested browsers. Internet Explorer has display glitches and may require ChromeFrame for some pages. Opera is untested.</p><p>For this release, Mozilla 3.5, Safari, or Chrome is recommended.&#160; The long-term goal is to support all popular browsers, although some display glitches may exist in browsers that require high efforts for compatibility.</p><p>ObjectCloud does not use Flash, Flex, or Silverlight although applications built on top of ObjectCloud might use them.</p>"}
