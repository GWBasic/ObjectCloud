ObjectCloud currently does not\ninstall itself and must be started manually. On Mac and Linux,\nObjectCloud requires a recent version of <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html\">Mono</a>. (2.4) See the <a target=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"/Docs/requirements.page\">requirements</a> for more information.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Note</span>: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Be careful where you extract ObjectCloud. It might not work if extracted onto a network share, or in a folder synchronized by a utility like <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://www.getdropbox.com/\">Dropbox</a>.</span><br/>\n</p>\n<h1>Running ObjectCloud</h1>ObjectCloud is a server that is run at the command-line. There is no GUI except for what is seen in the web browser.<br/>\n<h2>Windows</h2>\n<p>Make sure that you have .Net 3.5.</p><blockquote class=\"webkit-indent-blockquote\" style=\"margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;\"><p><b>Note</b>: <i>ObjectCloud is tested on Windows 7 as an Administrator. Getting it to run under a normal user account is currently unsupported.</i></p></blockquote><p>Open the directory that you installed ObjectCloud into, and double-click on the ObjectCloud application file. (Either ObjectCloud or ObjectCloud.exe) If you see \"Windows Firewall has blocked some features of this program,\" click \"Allow Access.\"</p><p><img src=\"/Docs/walkthrough/grant%20access.png\"/></p>\n<h2>Mac / Linux</h2>\n<p>Open a shell (terminal) and cd to the directory that ObjectCloud is installed into.

The URL defaults to the host computer's IP at port 1080. Your URL will most likely be different then the one shown above.<br/></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Note:</span>&#160;<i>In order for OpenID to work correctly, ObjectCloud needs to know its host name. ObjectCloud also defaults to port 1080</i><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-style: italic; \">&#160;due to security restrictions in Unixes.</span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">&#160;Setting a hostname and port are discussed in </span><a style=\"font-style: italic;\" target=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"public_internet.page\">Putting ObjectCloud on the public internet</a><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">.</span></p><p>Open a browser using the provided URL: (http://those weird numbers/) Don't forget to use the :1080!</p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Note:</span> <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">We&#160;recommend&#160;using Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari. Although we like supporting all browsers, Internet Explorer may have some display glitches and doesn't support all functionality.</span></p><p>If all goes well, you will see a page similar to the following:</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/Docs/walkthrough/browser%20opened.png\" align=\"none\"/><br/></p><p>Did you get some error when trying to connect? Make sure you type in the URL displayed from the \"Server is waiting for a new connection at...\" message, including the :1080 part.<br/></p><p>Now that you've connected to ObjectCloud, it's time to log in. For now, log in as root. Type \"root\" into the Username box, and \"root\" into the password box. Click on the \"login\" button. Omit the quotes.<br/></p><p>When you are logged in as root, the page's background becomes red. This is a security feature.</p><h2>Changing Root's password</h2><p><img alt=\"Our gorgeously handsome programmer, Andrew Rondeau, expresses his fear about pickpockets and loose women\" src=\"/Docs/walkthrough/beware-of-pickpockets-and-l.jpg\" align=\"right\"/>The first thing you should do once you get ObjectCloud running is to change root's password. If you don't do, hackers will fill up your ObjectCloud instance with gremlins, pickpockets, and loose women. They might also blackmail you with pictures from that party in... Oh wait, we agreed never to talk about that again!</p><p>Type in the new root password and click \"change password.\"</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/Docs/walkthrough/change%20password.png\" align=\"none\"/></p><p>You should see a dialog that says, \"Password Changed\"</p><h1>Creating Accounts</h1><p>After setting up a root password, the next step is to create two accounts. Click on \"Change User\" in the upper-right corner of the browser, and then \"Create Account.\"</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://10.0.1.198:1080/Docs/walkthrough/create%20user.png\" align=\"none\"/></p><p>Once on the \"Create Account\" page, type in the user name and password for the new account. In these examples, \"patrick\" and \"ellie\" are the user names.</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://10.0.1.198:1080/Docs/walkthrough/create%20account.png\" align=\"none\"/></p><p>When you click \"create account,\" you will see a dialog stating that the new user was created. Create the second account.</p><blockquote class=\"webkit-indent-blockquote\" style=\"margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;\"><p><b>Note</b>: <i>For security reasons, the default setting is that only root can create users and groups, but you may grant other users permission to create accounts and groups.</i></p></blockquote><h1>Setting Avatars (Profile Pictures)</h1><p>After creating two accounts, (\"patrick\" and \"ellie\" are used in these examples,) click on \"Change User\" and log in as one of the new accounts.</p><p><img src=\"/Docs/walkthrough/log in.png\"/></p><p>Click on \"Files\" on the left of the page.</p><p><img src=\"/Docs/walkthrough/click on files.png\"/></p><p>Under \"Upload,\" click on \"Browse.\"</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://10.0.1.198:1080/Docs/walkthrough/upload%20image.png\" align=\"none\"/></p><p>The new image should appear as the first entry in the user's list of files.

Remove the domain from the URL so it starts with /Users/... Replace any %20s with a space. (See below)</p><p>Click \"Change Avatar,\" and then refresh. When done correctly, the avatar should change.</p><p><img src=\"/Docs/walkthrough/change avatar.png\"/></p><p>Repeat the above steps for the other user.</p><h1>Status Updates</h1><p>Click on the ObjectCloud logo on the upper-left corner of the browser to return to the main page.</p><blockquote class=\"webkit-indent-blockquote\" style=\"margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;\"><p><b>Note</b>: <i>You can change this page as root.

You should see a notification for the shared file show up.</p><p><img src=\"/Docs/walkthrough/shared.png\"/></p><h1>Sharing with Other Servers</h1><p>It's possible to share with users on other servers. If they are using an ObjectCloud server, they will see notifications when items are shared. If they aren't using ObjectCloud, they must know the proper URL to navigate to.</p><p>You can experiment with multiple servers. You can run ObjectCloud on another computer within the same network, or you can run multiple instances of ObjectCloud on the same computer.</p><p>When running multiple instances of ObjectCloud on the same computer, each instance must run in its own folder and have its own port. For the second instance, open its ObjectCloudConfix.xml and change the port number from 1080 to something else.</p><p>In ObjectCloud, a user's OpenID is http://hostname/Users/username.user. For example, in the above examples, Ellie's OpenID is&#160;http://10.0.1.11:1080/Users/ellie.user.</p><blockquote class=\"webkit-indent-blockquote\" style=\"margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;\"><p><b>Note</b>: <i><a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"http://code.google.com/p/webfinger/\">WebFinger</a>, a system to make OpenIDs look like email addresses, is on <a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"/Docs/roadmap.page\">ObjectCloud's roadmap</a>.</i></p></blockquote><h1>Stopping ObjectCloud</h1>\n<p>On Windows, ObjectCloud stops when a key is pushed. On Linux or\nMac, ObjectCloud stops when it gets a SIGINT signal after you push\ncontrol-C.</p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><h1>Putting ObjectCloud on the public internet</h1><p>There are&#160;<a xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" href=\"http://10.0.1.198:1080/Docs/public_internet.page\">additional configuration options</a>&#160;to consider when putting ObjectCloud on the public internet. You may host it from your home computer if you're comfortable running a server and forwarding ports from your router. You may also host it at a cloud provider if you're comfortable configuring and administering a remote Linux server.</p><div><br/></div>\n"}
