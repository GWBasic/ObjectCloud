{"Title":"Walkthrough","Contents":"<p><a href=\"about.page\">About ObjectCloud</a></p>\n<p>This page walks you through basic installation and simple uses of ObjectCloud.</p>\n<h1>Download and Install</h1>\n<p>Download ObjectCloud from <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://andrewrondeau.com/ObjectCloud/Releases/\">http://andrewrondeau.com/ObjectCloud/Releases/</a> and extract the zip file to wherever\nyou plan on installing ObjectCloud.&#160; (Make sure to select the newest file.)&#160; ObjectCloud currently does not\ninstall itself and must be started manually.&#160; On Mac and Linux,\nObjectCloud requires a recent version of <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html\">Mono</a>.&#160; (2.4)&#160; See the <a target=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"/Docs/requirements.page\">requirements</a> for more information.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Note</span>:&#160; <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Be careful where you extract ObjectCloud.&#160; It might not work if extracted onto a network share, or in a folder synchronized by a utility like <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://www.getdropbox.com/\">Dropbox</a>.</span><br/>\n</p>\n<h1>Running ObjectCloud</h1>ObjectCloud is a server that is run at the command-line.&#160; There is no GUI except for what is seen in the web browser.<br/>\n<h2>Windows</h2>\n<p>Open the directory that you installed ObjectCloud into, and double-click on the ObjectCloud application file.&#160; (Either ObjectCloud or ObjectCloud.exe)<br/></p>\n<h2>Mac / Linux</h2>\n<p>Open a shell (terminal) and cd to the directory that ObjectCloud is installed into.&#160; Type \"mono ObjectCloud.exe\"</p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Note</span>:&#160; <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">ObjectCloud requires </span><a style=\"font-style: italic;\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html\">mono</a><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> on Linux and Mac</span>.<br/></p>\n<h1>Viewing ObjectCloud from a browser for the first time</h1>\n<p>ObjectCloud takes a few seconds to load.&#160; While it is loading, you will see some gibberish fly through the screen.&#160; This is because ObjectCloud uses the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://www.springframework.net/\">Spring.Net</a> framework for <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://www.springframework.net/doc-latest/reference/html/objects.html#objects-factory-collaborators\">dependency injection</a>.<br/></p><p>When ObjectCloud is ready, you will see a screen like the following:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"walkthrough/server%20started.png\" align=\"none\"/></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Note</span>:&#160; <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Windows might give you a warning when you run ObjectCloud for the first time.&#160; This is expected, and it is because ObjectCloud lets external computers connect to your computer.&#160; Instruct windows to let ObjectCloud access the internet.</span><br/></p><p>When ObjectCloud is ready for you to view it in a web browser, it says  \"Server is waiting for a new connection at...\"&#160; The URL given is where your web browser can access  ObjectCloud.&#160; The URL defaults to the host computer's IP at port 1080.&#160; Your URL will most likely be different then the one shown above.<br/></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Notes:</span>&#160; <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">ObjectCloud needs to know its\nhostname in order for OpenID and messaging to work correctly.&#160; It\ndefaults to using its IP as its hostname.&#160; ObjectCloud also defaults to port 1080 due to security restrictions in Unixes.&#160; This behavior allows you to test-drive ObjectCloud in a secure manner on a local network without extensive configuration.&#160; Setting a proper hostname and port are discussed in </span><a style=\"font-style: italic;\" target=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"public_internet.page\">Putting ObjectCloud on the public internet</a><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">.</span></p><p>Open a browser using the provided URL:&#160; (http://those weird numbers/)&#160; Don't forget to use the :1080!</p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Notes:</span>&#160; <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">ObjectCloud is primarily tested with Mozilla and Safari on Mac; although some Internet Explorer testing is performed.&#160; When using Internet Explorer, turn compatibility mode on.&#160; Even though browser compatibility is a high priority; using Internet Explorer is strongly discouraged in this version.</span><br/></p><p>If all goes well, you will see a page similar to the following:</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/Docs/walkthrough/browser%20opened.png\" align=\"none\"/><br/></p><p>Did you get some error when trying to connect?&#160; Don't forget to add :1080 to the URL!&#160; (It's circled above.)&#160; Make sure you type in the URL displayed from the \"Server is waiting for a new connection at...\" message.<br/></p><p>Now that you've connected to ObjectCloud, it's time to log in.&#160; For now, log in as root.&#160; Type \"root\" into the Username box, and \"root\" into the password box.&#160; Click on the \"login\" button.&#160; Omit the quotes.<br/></p><h2>Changing Root's password</h2><p><img alt=\"Our gorgeously handsome programmer, Andrew Rondeau, expresses his fear about pickpockets and loose women\" src=\"/Docs/walkthrough/beware-of-pickpockets-and-l.jpg\" align=\"right\"/>The first thing you should do once you get ObjectCloud running is to change root's password.&#160; If you don't do, hackers will fill up your ObjectCloud instance with gremlins, pickpockets, and loose women.&#160; They might also blackmail you with pictures from that party in...&#160; Oh wait, we agreed never to talk about that again!</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/Docs/walkthrough/logged%20in.png\" align=\"none\"/><br/></p><p>Click on the \"My Account\" to go to root's account administration page.</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/Docs/walkthrough/change%20password.png\" align=\"none\"/></p><p>Type in the old password. \"root,\" and the new password.&#160;
