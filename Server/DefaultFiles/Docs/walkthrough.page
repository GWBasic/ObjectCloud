<p>This page walks you through basic installation and simple uses of ObjectCloud.</p>
<h1>Download and Install</h1>
<p>Download ObjectCloud from <a target="_blank" title="" href="http://andrewrondeau.com/ObjectCloud/Releases/">http://andrewrondeau.com/ObjectCloud/Releases/</a> and extract the zip file to wherever
you plan on installing ObjectCloud.&nbsp; (Make sure to select the newest file.)&nbsp; ObjectCloud currently does not
install itself and must be started manually.&nbsp; On Mac and Linux,
ObjectCloud requires a recent version of <a target="_blank" title="" href="http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html">Mono</a>.&nbsp; (2.4)&nbsp; See the <a target="" title="" href="/Docs/requirements.page">requirements</a> for more information.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>:&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Be careful where you extract ObjectCloud.&nbsp; It might not work if extracted onto a network share, or in a folder synchronized by a utility like <a target="_blank" title="" href="http://www.getdropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>.</span><br>
</p>
<h1>Running ObjectCloud</h1>ObjectCloud is a server that is run at the command-line.&nbsp; There is no GUI except for what is seen in the web browser.<br>
<h2>Windows</h2>
<p>Open the directory that you installed ObjectCloud into, and double-click on the ObjectCloud application file.&nbsp; (Either ObjectCloud or ObjectCloud.exe)<br></p>
<h2>Mac / Linux</h2>
<p>Open a shell (terminal) and cd to the directory that ObjectCloud is installed into.&nbsp; Type "mono ObjectCloud.exe"</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>:&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">ObjectCloud requires </span><a style="font-style: italic;" target="_blank" title="" href="http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html">mono</a><span style="font-style: italic;"> on Linux and Mac</span>.<br></p>
<h1>Viewing ObjectCloud from a browser for the first time</h1>
<p>ObjectCloud takes a few seconds to load.&nbsp; While it is loading, you will see some gibberish fly through the screen.&nbsp; This is because ObjectCloud uses the <a target="_blank" title="" href="http://www.springframework.net/">Spring.Net</a> framework for <a target="_blank" title="" href="http://www.springframework.net/doc-latest/reference/html/objects.html#objects-factory-collaborators">dependency injection</a>.<br></p><p>When ObjectCloud is ready, you will see a screen like the following:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="walkthrough/server%20started.png" align="none"></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>:&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Windows might give you a warning when you run ObjectCloud for the first time.&nbsp; This is expected, and it is because ObjectCloud lets external computers connect to your computer.&nbsp; Instruct windows to let ObjectCloud access the internet.</span><br></p><p>When ObjectCloud is ready for you to view it in a web browser, it says  "Server is waiting for a new connection at..."&nbsp; The URL given is where your web browser can access  ObjectCloud.&nbsp; The URL defaults to the host computer's IP at port 1080.&nbsp; Your URL will most likely be different then the one shown above.<br></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Notes:</span>&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">ObjectCloud needs to know its
hostname in order for OpenID and messaging to work correctly.&nbsp; It
defaults to using its IP as its hostname.&nbsp; ObjectCloud also defaults to port 1080 due to security restrictions in Unixes.&nbsp; This behavior allows you to test-drive ObjectCloud in a secure manner on a local network without extensive configuration.&nbsp; Setting a proper hostname and port are discussed in </span><a style="font-style: italic;" target="" title="" href="public_internet.page">Putting ObjectCloud on the public internet</a><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></p><p>Open a browser using the provided URL:&nbsp; (http://those weird numbers/)&nbsp; Don't forget to use the :1080!</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Notes:</span>&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">ObjectCloud is primarily tested with Mozilla and Safari on Mac; although some Internet Explorer testing is performed.&nbsp; When using Internet Explorer, turn compatibility mode on.&nbsp; Even though browser compatibility is a high priority; using Internet Explorer is strongly discouraged in this version.</span><br></p><p>If all goes well, you will see a page similar to the following:</p><p><img alt="" src="/Docs/walkthrough/browser%20opened.png" align="none"><br></p><p>Did you get some error when trying to connect?&nbsp; Don't forget to add :1080 to the URL!&nbsp; (It's circled above.)&nbsp; Make sure you type in the URL displayed from the "Server is waiting for a new connection at..." message.<br></p><p>Now that you've connected to ObjectCloud, it's time to log in.&nbsp; For now, log in as root.&nbsp; Type "root" into the Username box, and "root" into the password box.&nbsp; Click on the "login" button.&nbsp; Omit the quotes.<br></p><h2>Changing Root's password</h2><p><img alt="Our gorgeously handsome programmer, Andrew Rondeau, expresses his fear about pickpockets and loose women" src="/Docs/walkthrough/beware-of-pickpockets-and-l.jpg" align="right">The first thing you should do once you get ObjectCloud running is to change root's password.&nbsp; If you don't do, hackers will fill up your ObjectCloud instance with gremlins, pickpockets, and loose women.&nbsp; They might also blackmail you with pictures from that party in...&nbsp; Oh wait, we agreed never to talk about that again!</p><p><img alt="" src="/Docs/walkthrough/logged%20in.png" align="none"><br></p><p>Click on the "My Account" to go to root's account administration page.</p><p><img alt="" src="/Docs/walkthrough/change%20password.png" align="none"></p><p>Type in the old password.
