To Run:

1) install node.js
    http://tinyclouds.org/node/

2) Make sure that the jsio symbolic link in this directory is correct (that is, it points at the jsio library)

3) run node start_with_node.js

4) serve the index.html file somehow
    Keep in mind that firefox (and others?) will not work with XHR + symbolic links, so you 
    actually have to serve index.html from some webserver. You can, of course, replace the 
    jsio symbolic link with an actual copy of the jsio library and you can skip even having
    a webserver.

5) navigate to index.html

Enjoy!
